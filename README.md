## Project Topic

Can you make spurious correlations among seemingly unrelated categories using maching learning?  Also, can one category (i.e. music preference) predict the response to another (i.e. phobias)?  

## Rationale 

We all have our preferences and our idiosyncrasies.  It would be interesting for our audience to see how some may correlate.  We also are interested in being able to predict some characteristic based on others.  

## Data Sets

A survey was given out to young people (15-30) who were associated with students in the Social
and Economic Sciences department of Comenius University in Bratislava.  The questions can be grouped in to the following categories: music preferences, movie preferences, hobbies & interests, phobias, health habits, personality traits, spending habits, and demographics.

## Project Stack

What ML algorithms are you considering?
Which libraries, tools, and technology will you use?

Scikit learn

stats models: logistic regression https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/regression.html

Python/pandas

Tableau (and maybe D3)


## Project Goals

Make some correlations and also some predictions.  Have a website with some stuff on it.

Do you any alternative plans if something doesn't go as expected?
Our dataset is varied enough that if a question doesn't work, we can create a new question.
